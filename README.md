# a cheap a_n_i_v clone

A simple and lightweight Twitch chat bot that learns from chat messages and generates responses using the Markov chain algorithm.

> [!WARNING]  
> Before adding this bot to any channel, make sure that you have the streamer's permission. The messages this bot generates are clearly gibberish 50% of the time, and people *will* find out the user is not human sooner than you think. This *will* leads to you getting banned in most cases.

## I want this thing on my channel. What do I do?

I am currently hosting a copy of it and I have no problem adding your twitch channel to the list of joined channel.

 Ask politely. Open an issue to get in touch, or reach out in some ways or another idk.

There will be an issue template for [Hosting Requests] soon :tm:
