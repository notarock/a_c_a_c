            The channel has been added to the configuration file successfully.
            
            acac should join your channel soon! To check if acac is here, you can use the '!acac' command. When used by the channel owner, it forces the bot to send a message. Make sure to send at least one message prior to using the command so acac has something to learn from.           
            
            If you have any questions or problems with acac, feel free to reopen this issue or create a new one. Enjoy!
